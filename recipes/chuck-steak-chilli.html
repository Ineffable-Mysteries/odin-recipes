  <h1>Chuck Steak Chilli</h1>
  <img src="../img/Texas-Beef-Chili.jpg" width="600">

  <p>This recipe uses chuck steak to create a hearty and substantial chilli that is closer to a casserole than typical mince-based chillis. Like many good things it takes time but your patience will be rewarded with a rich, meaty, and smoky gravy with a lovely depth of flavour that just doesn't compare to quicker methods!</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>The inclusion of beans is somewhat controversial amongst chilli purists, so is completely optional depending on your personal preference. They do help add more texture to the dish, can help balance the richness of the sauce, and bulk it out for more meals too.
  <!-- <br> -->
  <p><em>Makes 4-6 servings</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 large red capsicum (or 1 store-bought fire roasted capsicum)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp neutral oil (e.g. canola)</li>
    <li>1kg chuck steak, cut into roughly 3cm cubes</li>
    <li>1-2 rashers smoked middle bacon, diced</li>
    <li>1 large brown onion, diced</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 jalapenos, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
    <li>700g passata</li>
    <li>500ml quality beef stock</li>
    <li>400g can black beans, drained (optional, or use other beans as preferred)</li>
    <li>cornflour, to thicken (optional)</li>
    <li>lime wedges, to garnish</li>
    <br><strong> Dried spice blend</strong>
    <li>4 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>4 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>2 tsp smoked paprika </li>
    <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>1 tbsp cocoa powder (unsweetened)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  
  For best results fire roast your capsicum at home, otherwise you can substitute with the fire roasted capsicums in a jar that are available at most supermarkets.

  <ol>
    <li>
      Fire roast the red capsicum whole by placing it directly over a gas burner and 
      turning with tongues until blackened all over, or use a cooking torch to achieve
      the same result. Remove from heat and wrap snugly in foil. Rest for 5-10 minutes
      - this helps loosen the skin. Remove the foil, and once the capsicum is just 
      cool enough to touch, remove the skin; it should mostly slip away easily. Make
      sure not to use water as it will wash away flavour. Once skin is removed, deseed and dice.
      If using store-bought, drain 1 capsicum and dice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat the oil to a medium-high heat in a large casserole pot. Add enough beef to
      cover the bottom of the pan in a single layer, and brown all over. Set aside.
      Repeat this with the remaining beef in batches until all the beef is browned.
      Leave any remaining oil in the pan.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce heat to Low-Medium and fry the bacon until it just begins to brown.
      Add the onion, capsisum, jalapenos, and garlic, and fry until softened.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add the spice blend, stirring to coat the other ingredients, ensuring
      spices don't stick to the bottom of the pot and burn.
    </li>
    <li>
      Return the browned beef to the pan, including any retained juices,
      and stir to thoroughly mix all ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir through the passata and beef stock. Increase heat and bring to the boil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduce heat to low and cook, semi-covered, for 1-2 hours, until beef
      is tender and sauce has thickened. Stir regularly to make sure the
      sauce doesn't catch. If the sauce becomes too dry add a small amount of water .
    </li>
    <li>
      Once beef is soft, taste sauce and add salt as needed. To further thicken sauce,
      make a 1:1 slurry with cornflour and cold water. Start with 2 tsp cornflour, and
      add more if needed. Add gradually to the sauce, stirring through thoroughly
      until desired thickness is reached.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cook for another 5-10 minutes to incorporate the salt and cook any cornflour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Serve over rice with lime wedges. Add extra chilli sauce if desired, Cholula and Tabasco both work well.
    </li>
  </ol>
